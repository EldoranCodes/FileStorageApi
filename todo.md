Follow this sequence so your progress is clean and you avoid refactoring hell:

Step 1 — Build the Folder/Path config
(No upload yet)

Step 2 — Build the Metadata entity + repository
(No upload yet)

Step 3 — Build a service method that takes a filename and creates a path for it.
(No upload yet; just generate paths)

Step 4 — Implement file saving
(Start with writing to simple folder)

Step 5 — Build controller to expose upload endpoint
Step 6 — Try uploading files during local run

Fix your errors yourself; I only guide.

Step 7 — Add workspace/user folder logic
Step 8 — Add Docker volume storage
